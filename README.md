# Life Expectancy Prediction Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict life expectancy in various countries using a dataset provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)â€™s Global Health Observatory (GHO). The analysis considers a range of indicators from 2000 to 2015, including health, economic, and social factors.

## Data Description
The life expectancy dataset encompasses several indicators for all countries, capturing aspects such as:

1. Immunization factors
2. Mortality factors
3. Economic factors
4. Social factors
5. Other health-related factors  
These indicators are utilized to understand and predict how various factors influence the life expectancy of populations globally.

## Objective
The main goal is to design, train, and evaluate a neural network model for regression that can accurately predict the life expectancy of countries based on the extensive indicators available in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Implementation
### Preprocessing
- StandardScaler: Used for normalizing the dataset to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.
- Missing Values: Imputation strategies are applied for handling any missing data, typically by filling in with the mean or median of the respective columns.
### Model Development
- Neural Network with TensorFlow and Keras:
- Architecture: A Sequential model, starting with an input layer sized to the number of features, followed by one or more Dense layers with ReLU activation for hidden layers, and ending with a single neuron output layer for regression.
- Compilation: The model is compiled using the adam optimizer and a loss function suitable for regression, such as mean_squared_error.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
